# `@overkill-dev/stryker-runner`

Optional first-party Stryker `TestRunner` plugin for Node microtest profiles.
Profile initialization is available; dry runs, mutant execution, and capability
reporting are not implemented yet.

```js
export default {
    testRunner: 'overkill',
    plugins: [ '@overkill-dev/stryker-runner' ],
    overkill: {
        configPath: 'overkill.config.ts',
        profile: 'unit-fast'
    }
};
```

Omit `configPath` or set it to `null` for normal Overkill config discovery from
the Stryker worker's cwd. Omit `profile` or set it to `null` to infer the sole
microtest profile in the normalized registry. The built-in `microtest` fallback
counts: adding a custom microtest profile normally requires an explicit name.
An explicitly configured `microtest` profile replaces that fallback.

Unknown names, non-microtest profiles, absent eligible profiles, ambiguous
inference, and malformed settings fail before discovery or test imports.
Browser-oriented integration profiles and multi-profile selections are rejected.
Other profile families may coexist in the project registry. Profile names do not
determine eligibility. Incompatible test nodes are checked during collection.

Initialization preserves the selected profile's policy and imports no test
modules. Repeated initialization shares one result, including failures.
