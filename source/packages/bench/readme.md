# @overkill-dev/bench

Ordinary test-node authoring for the Overkill benchmark package.

Included in the standard `@overkill-dev/test` installation. Standard users
import the same authoring surface from `@overkill-dev/test/bench`; advanced
consumers can install and import `@overkill-dev/bench` directly. Bench code
stays outside root `@overkill-dev/test` imports and ordinary microtest startup.

The current facade exports `test`, `skippedTest`, `suite`, `table`,
`defineMacro`, and `defineParameterizedTestBody`. These are the same
family-neutral constructors used by `@overkill-dev/test`, with the same
assertion, validation, and source-location behavior.

```ts
import { suite, test } from '@overkill-dev/bench';

const fixture = { entries: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] };

export const testNode = suite('fixture validation', [
    test('contains the expected entries', (scope) => {
        scope.assert.equal(fixture.entries.length, 5);
        return scope.assert.collect();
    })
]);
```

Nodes compose with ordinary `@overkill-dev/test` suites, tables, and macros.
Creating a node does not execute its body or select a test family.

Public types include `AuthoringAnnotations`, `AuthoringControls`,
`ParameterizedTestScope`, `TableDefinition`, `TableTestBody`, `Suite`,
`Table`, `TestBody`, `TestCase`, `TestNode`, `TestScope`, and
`TestScopeAssertContext`.

The `@overkill-dev/test` binary runs benchmark profiles through
`overkill bench run [paths...]` and lists their resolved plan through
`overkill bench list [paths...]`. Configure a shared project profile:

```ts
export const config = defineConfig({
    profiles: {
        startup: { testFamily: 'benchmark', files: { include: [ 'source/**/*.bench.ts' ] } }
    }
});
```

Omitting `--profile` selects the sole benchmark profile. Missing, ambiguous,
unknown, or ordinary-family selections return argument error `3`.
Both commands accept shared file, title, filter, runtime, order, seed, and shard
selection flags. Run also supports capture, precise timings, worker requests,
and diagnostic resource usage. List supports locations and orphans.

Benchmarks use the regular resource lifecycle, assertion results, attachments,
and configured reporters. Listing imports definitions but does not run bodies,
acquire resources, instantiate reporters, or write run history.
Execution defaults to a reused worker pool with serial scheduling, one case at
a time, and one executor lane across the run. Worker requests and profile caps
remain visible in execution facts. Supervised execution and fresh workers are
also supported. Hedging and concurrent groups are rejected.
Default timeouts are 5000 ms for collection, 40000 ms soft, and 60000 ms hard.
Overrides must keep soft at or below hard and hard at or below 60000 ms.

This facade does not yet measure performance. `benchmark(...)`, workloads,
measurement strategies, and budgets are separate implementation milestones.
Advanced authoring and runtime binding remain available from
`@overkill-dev/test` and its resources subpath.
